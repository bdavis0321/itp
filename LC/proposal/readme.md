## Live Coding Research Project Proposal

For my research project, I want to explore the techniques used to chop and sequence drum breaks using live coding. I was mainly inspired by Switch Angel's videos explaining her techniques within Strudel. I'm interested in both the sequencing and arranging aspect, as well as the generative side with both the chops and the live effects manipulation.
