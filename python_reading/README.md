# Week 10 - Think Python

Back in week 3, I accidentally did the Python reading instead of the actual Javascript assignment, as the links were swapped in Canvas, so I have already previously read through chapters 1, 3, 5, and 10. However, I still went back and reread through them again, and added some additional thoughts to the notes that I initially took when accidentally reading it back in week 3. 

### Chapter 1 - Way of the Program
One thing I had already known from this chapter was the difference between integers and floating-point numbers, and how using commas in large numbers is not legal for integers, eg. 1000000 (legal integer) vs 1,000,000 (illegal). Although, I did not know that Python treats the commas as separating a sequence of separate integers. Another bit I did not previously know was that a string is called that because the characters are 'strung' together within quotations, and that even numbers within the quotations are treated as strings. 

When going back to this chapter again, I found the section describing the differences between natural and formal languages very interesting. The article describes natural language to be much more ambiguous and redundant, while formal languages are literal and concise, meaning exactly what is written and nothing more. While the article describes this as making natural language more redundant and less efficient than formal language, I think there could be an argument made on how the ability to make assumptions and use context when speaking actually allows for more efficiency than formal language. For example, I can say "yesterday" when speaking, and nothing more needs to be said as both parties understand what day I'm referring to, while a computer needs to be told yesterday means Monday November 18th, 2024 (more specifically 1732036856 seconds since January 1st, 1970 lol). Obviously this is a broad generalizations and computers actually can make assumptions using different methods, but I still think communication efficiency is very difficult to measure. 


### Chapter 3 - Functions
In this chapter, I already knew that when converting a floating-point value to an integer, rather than rounding up, it just cuts off the decimal value, eg. 3.9999 becomes 3. I did not know the method of defining a function in Python, as well as the difference between "straight quotes" and ”curly quotes”.

### Chapter 5 - Conditions and Recursion
In this chapter, I had already known about the boolean expressions and their syntax, as well as the logical operators, conditional execution, and most of the conditionals. I did not know about any of the keyboard input functions, as well as the recursive functions.

### Chapter 10 - Lists
Most of the stuff in this chapter was new to me, except the more basic stuff in 10.1, for example, being able to nest lists, eg. ['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]. One thing I didn't know that I thought was interesting was being able to filter lists, for example, the chapter shows a function that takes strings from the previous list, and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings.
