# Documentation

I have to admit that when coming up with the idea for this project originally, I drastically underestimated how challenging it would be to put together and implement even half of the features I had intended. In the end, although I didn't completely reach my goal, I learned so much from the experience and would definitely do a project like it again. 

When starting this project, I reached out to my friend Maxwell for advice on the different ways I could go about putting it together. Maxwell and I have worked together on projects such as VST plugins or even Minecraft mods, and he has a bit more experience in this area than I do. He helped me in setting up node.js and how I would configure it to run remotely on our shared cermak.fr server.

After deciding to use the 'balldontlie.io' API, the first thing I did was figure out how I would call the data, in this case for players.
