# Band Project Reflection

There weren't really many problems faced, besides trying to be creative when making our bios and origin as a "band". Also it was frustrating how long it took for changes in the style.css sheet to update on my repository, so I would have to wait 5 minutes to see if something I did worked or broke the entire page.

I contributed to the group mainly by taking our ideas and what we had written down and putting them into the index.html and also figuring out the style sheet.

We all contributed equally in our group, with Cliff contributing the music track, Isaac contributing the images, and Tim helping with composing the bios.
