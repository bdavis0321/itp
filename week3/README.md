# Week 3 - Think Python

### Chapter 1 - Way of the Program
One thing I had already known from this chapter was the difference between integers and floating-point numbers, and how using commas in large numbers is not legal for integers, eg. 1000000 (legal integer) vs 1,000,000 (illegal). Although, I did not know that Python treats the commas as separating a sequence of separate integers. Another bit I did not previously know was that a string is called that because the characters are 'strung' together within quotations, and that even numbers within the quotations are treated as strings. 

### Chapter 3 - Functions
In this chapter, I already knew that when converting a floating-point value to an integer, rather than rounding up, it just cuts off the decimal value, eg. 3.9999 becomes 3. I did not know the method of defining a function in Python, as well as the difference between "straight quotes" and ”curly quotes”.

### Chapter 5 - Conditions and Recursion
In this chapter, I had already known about the boolean expressions and their syntax, as well as the logical operators, conditional execution, and most of the conditionals. I did not know about any of the keyboard input functions, as well as the recursive functions.

### Chapter 10 - Lists
Most of the stuff in this chapter was new to me, except the more basic stuff in 10.1, for example, being able to nest lists, eg. ['spam', 2.0, 5, [10, 20]]. One thing I didn't know that I thought was interesting was being able to filter lists, for example, the chapter shows a function that takes strings from the previous list, and returns a new list that contains capitalized strings.
